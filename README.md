## Project Overview
This repository contains a fully worked and pedagogically structured set of mathematical derivations and R implementations for core inferential statistical techniques. The goal is to provide a clear, rigorous, and reproducible guide to Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Method of Moments, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals for foundational probability distributions.

The project is written in R Markdown, combining LaTeX-based mathematical exposition with executable R code, making it ideal for learning, reviewing, or showcasing applied mathematical reasoning.

### Acknowledgments
This project was developed as a study and demonstration tool for understanding how classical inferential statistical methods are derived and applied. It focuses on clarity, pedagogy, and reproducibility rather than real-world datasets.

If you’d like to extend the repository to include more distributions or inference frameworks, contributions are welcome!
